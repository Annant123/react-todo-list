# React To-Do List with User Authentication
A simple React-based To-Do List application with user-specific task management. Tasks are stored in local storage, ensuring persistence between sessions. The app includes basic authentication (login/signup) and allows users to add, edit, delete and read tasks.

## Features
User Authentication: Login and signup functionality.
Task Management: Add, read , edit, delete tasks.
Local Storage Persistence: Each user's tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and are retrieved upon login.
